# Box Kaster Lite

This is technically the first iteration of the [Box Kaster](https://github.com/armbahl/Box-Kaster) program, just written in C++ and uses the CLI.

It has fewer quality of life features, but has all of the main functions needed to make a proper cardboard box.

## Compilation

You can usually compile this program using your favorite C++ compiler. I personally prefer [GCC(G++)](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

If you are unfamiliar with how to compile a C++ program through GCC, the syntax is usually as follows:

```g++ -g -Wall /PATH/TO/MAIN.CPP -o /PATH/TO/OUTPUT```

If you need GCC for Windows, you can use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) to download and install it. This is the simplest option, in my opinion.
